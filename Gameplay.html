	<p>
	Fallout: New Vegas' gameplay consists of a mix between RPG and action elements. It has the same gameplay as Fallout 3, with some added improvements.
	Iron sights can be use on weapons, and the 3rd-person view has been improved since Fallout 3. 
	The player can enter V.A.T.S. during the game, an assisted targeting mode where the player can select enemies to attack, at the cost of Action Points and the risk of the attack missing.
