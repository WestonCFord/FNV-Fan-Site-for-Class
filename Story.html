	<p class="img-description">Part of the opening cutscene of Fallout: New Vegas, which kicks the story off.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="text-center">Fallout: New Vegas takes place in the Amercan West, it is not a true sequel to Fallout 3. Its story borrows more from Fallout 1 and Fallout 2.
	<p>
	Fallout: New Vegas' story follows the adventures of Courier Six, played by the character, a courier for the Mojave Express.
	The courier was supposed to deliver a platinum poker chip to Mr. House, the enigmatic Big Brother of the New Vegas strip.
	Courier Six was captured, and shot in the head.
	Courier Six later woke in the home of Doc Mitchell, of Goodsprings.
	With his head fixed, Courier Six set out to find the man in the checkered suit that had shot him.
	Courier Six later found the man who shot him, Benny, and was informed that the Platinum Chip contained upgrades for Mr. House's secret Securitron army.
	This is where the courier gets caught up in the battle for control of New Vegas, and where the storyline splits into 4 parts.
	</p>
	<p class="text-center">There are four major factions that can be sided with to get a different ending to the game.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Mr. House: Mr. House wants to drive both the NCR and Caesar's Legion out of New Vegas, keeping control of New Vegas and taking over Hoover Dam.</li>
	<br>
	<li>the New California Republic: The NCR wants to hold Hoover Dam, kill Mr. House, and drive Caesar's Legion out of their territory.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Caesar's Legion: Caesar's Legion wants to crush the NCR, kill Mr. House, capture all areas west of the Colorado River, and establish an authoritarian government in which only the strong can survive.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Yes Man: Yes Man is a Securitron that Benny, the man in the checkered coat, hacked. Yes Man can access the Platinum Chip and take control of Mr. House's Securitron Army. Driving out all other factions, Yes Man will create a truly free New Vegas.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	
	<p>The game ends with whatever faction the player has sided with driving out the opposing faction(s) and taking Hoover Dam.</p>
